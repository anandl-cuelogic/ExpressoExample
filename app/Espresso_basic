- Espresso - onView(), onData(), pressBack
- ViewMatchers - onView()
- ViewAction - ViewInteraction.perform() method, such as click().
- ViewAssertion - ViewInteraction.check()


Steps to implements Espresso

* Find A View:
    - onView(withId(R.id.my_view))
    - onView(allOf(withId(R.id.my_view), withText("Hello!")))
    - AdapterView—such as ListView, GridView, or Spinner—the onView() method might not work. In these cases, you should use onData() instead.

* Perform an action on a view
   - onView(...).perform(click())
   - onView(...).perform(typeText("Hello"), click())
   - onView(...).perform(scrollTo(), click())

* Check view assertion
  - Assertions can be applied to the currently selected view with the check() method
  - The most used assertion is the matches() assertion.
